## **Text_PreProcessing_Techniques_NLP**
This repository contains various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using the NLTK library in Python. It covers tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

### **Features**
- **Tokenization** : Splitting text into sentences and words.
- **Stemming** : Reducing words to their root forms using different stemming algorithms.
- **Lemmatization** : Converting words to their dictionary form.
- **Stopword** : Filtering out common words that do not add much meaning.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** : Identifying entities like names, locations, and dates in text.
